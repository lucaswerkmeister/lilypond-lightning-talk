# LilyPond (lightning talk)

These are the slides for a ten-minute lightning talk I held about LilyPond on two occasions:

* At work ([release][wmde-release], [PDF][wmde-pdf]), on 2019-01-24.
  This version of the slides can mostly stand on its own, feel free to take a look.
* At [EnthusiastiCon 2019][enthusiasticon] ([release][enthusiasticon-release], [PDF][enthusiasticon-pdf]), on 2019-05-25.
  This version has a lot less text on the slides and really needs the verbal commentary as well.
  The talk may have been recorded – I’ll add a link if it’s uploaded.
